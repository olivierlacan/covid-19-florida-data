# covid-19-florida-data
A normalized historical data set from irresponsibly disorganized Florida Department of Health reports

## Source

This data originally was made available at http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/ which the Florida Department of Health later (irresponsibly) redirected to https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/ (which obvsiously made using the [Wayback Machine][1] harder).

Now the most relevant data is hosted at a *third* URL on a completely different domain where FDH still doesn't list historical or trend data: https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429

## Methodology

When I wasn't able to find archival data in the Wayback Machine for certain days I simply filled the gaps using the data from previous days in order to make visualization more feasible.
